Educational Website

The website is for the lower primary school students, essentially the website will be used to teach students the basics to english, math and science. We plan to make a game where students have to answer the questions in order to gain points and be on a leaderboard.

Design Process

The website is for primary school students. We wanted to create an eduactional website that made it easy for students to learn and also test their knowledge. The website allows the students to learn more about grammar and vocabulary and also allows students to test themselves with the quiz website. It also allows parents or guardians of the students to find out more about their children's school and also to contact them.


Existing Features
Feature 1 - Quiz website, allows students to test themselves with a 12 question mcq.

Feature 2 - Dictionary api, allows students to search up the meaning of words.

Feature 3 - Navigation bar to allow students and parents to navigate the site easily.

Feature 4 - Slideshow of short paragraphs for students to read in order to improve on their english.

Features Left to Implement
Implement more slideshows, and also create other subjects website. Because now we only have the english education website.
