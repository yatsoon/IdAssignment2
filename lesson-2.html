    <h2>Here are some grammar rules to remember:</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Rule 1: A complete sentence must have a noun (a thing, person, place or an idea) and verb (an action or what the person is feeling)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Rule 2: A complete sentence must include a subject (person or thing doing something) and a predicate (part of the sentence that contains an action)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Rule 3: Only way to avoid rules 1 and 2 is an imperative sentece (tells someone to do something, gives advice or instruction or a request or command, usually no obvious subject).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Rule 4: Adjectives (a word that describes a noun) can go before the noun (a thing, person, place or an idea) they describe, or after it, if seperated by a verb (an action or what the person is feeling).</li>
        <br>
